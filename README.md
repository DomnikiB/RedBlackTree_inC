# RedBlackTree_inC

The above code is a product of my final dissertation in the undergraduate programme of the Physics Department of NKUA. It is a Red Black Tree based of a Binary Search Tree, in C. The operations supported are FIND_NODE, INSERT_NODE, DELETE_NODE and PRINT_TREE. I hope it helps your endeavors in Computer Science.
